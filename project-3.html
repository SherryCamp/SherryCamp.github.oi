                          <br>For this project I created all of the HTML & CSS from scratch. I used a Google font for all of the text of the website. For this design I used a mobile-first approach where I designed the mobile view of this project as the basis for the base CSS. I then added media query breakpoints at 768px and 1024px and styled those breakpoints respectively. I designed the form by using the form element and the basic form attributes. I used Flexbox to arrange all the form inputs. I added a dropdown for the state form field. I added input checkboxes and their respective labels. I used placeholder text for the form fields. I used form validation for the required form fields. I fulfilled the "exceeds expectations" requirements by adding a different background color for the header and main sections of the website and by using a CSS transition for the focus state of the outline to fade into view when brought into focus by selecting the input fields.

                    

                                This project was designed according to the provided mockups.

                          <br>
                          Exceeds Expectations Requirements:
                          <br><br>
                          Additional placeholder text for other text fields.

Use the required attribute to add HTML5 validation to make sure that required fields are filled out and input is formatted correctly.  <br>

Add at least the following additional styling enhancements to the form, feel free to add extra styling but leave the basic layout the same as the mockup.  <br>

Change the background color for at least ONE of the main sections of the site.  <br>
Uses CSS transitions for focus states.  <br>

For example, make a background color fade into view when the user clicks on a text field, and fade out when the user clicks or tabs out of the field.
