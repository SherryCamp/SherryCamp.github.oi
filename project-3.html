                <p>For this project I created all of the HTML & CSS from scratch. I used a Google font for all of the text of the website. For this design I used a mobile-first approach where I designed the mobile view of this project as the basis for the base CSS. I then added media query breakpoints at 768px and 1024px and styled those breakpoints respectively. I designed the form by using the form element and the basic form attributes. I used Flexbox to arrange all the form inputs. I added a dropdown for the state form field. I added input checkboxes and their respective labels. I used placeholder text for the form fields. I used form validation for the required form fields. I fulfilled the "exceeds expectations" requirements by adding a different background color for the header and main sections of the website and by using a CSS transition for the focus state of the outline to fade into view when brought into focus by selecting the input fields.</p>
                <p><strong>This project was designed according to the provided mockups.
                </strong></p>

                      <li>Additional placeholder text for other text fields.</li>
                      <li>Use the required attribute to add HTML5 validation to make sure that required fields are filled out and input is formatted correctly.</li>
                      <li>Add at least the following additional styling enhancements to the form, feel free to add extra styling but leave the basic layout the same as the mockup.</li>
                      <li>Change the background color for at least ONE of the main sections of the site.</li>
                      <li>Uses CSS transitions for focus states.</li>
                      <li>For example, make a background color fade into view when the user clicks on a text field, and fade out when the user clicks or tabs out of the field.</li>
