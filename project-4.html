                          <br>For this project I implemented Sass. I converted the provided CSS into Sass by creating a "scss" folder and created sub-folders inside of the scss folder for the base, component, and utilities partials. I changed the normalize.css file into a Sass partial and saved it to the base folder. I created a typography partial and saved it to the base folder. 
                           <br>I created different component partials that grouped together the major sections of the site. <br> Inside of the utilities folder, I created variables and mixins partials. In each of the scss sub-folders, I created an _index.scss file. These files are used to import individual partials from each sub-folder.   <br>
                           I created a styles.scss, which is used to import all of the _index.scss files from the sub-folders. <br> I used Scout-App to watch the Sass directories for changes and then automatically imported those changes to their respective Sass files. 
                            <br>I created 5 color variables. I created a variable to be used for all media queries. 
                             <br>I fulfilled the "exceeds expectations" requirements by using a media query mixin for all media queries, by using nested selectors, by creating a hover effect for buttons, which lighten the button's background color  and by adding a CSS transition so that the color change fades in.
                            <br>
                        This project was designed according to the provided mockups.

                          Exceeds Expectations Requirements:
                          <br><br>
                         Create a media query mixin.

Create a mixin that creates a media query inside of the selector that calls the mixin. <br>
The mixin should accept a single parameter for the size of the media query breakpoint. <br>
The mixin should create a min-width media query only. <br>
Use the media query mixin for all media queries. <br>

Use a nested selector structure for at least one component. <br>

Create a base selector for a group of related styles. <br>
Inside of that selector, use the Sass parent selector: & to append a child class selector to the base. An example would be in the navigation component use .nav as the base selector, and nest .nav-link inside of it. <br>
Use built in Sass function to add hover effect. <br>

Created a hover effect for buttons. <br>

Add a CSS transition so that the color change fades in. <br>
