               <p>For this project I implemented Sass. I converted the provided CSS into Sass by creating a "scss" folder and created sub-folders inside of the scss folder for the base, component, and utilities partials. I changed the normalize.css file into a Sass partial and saved it to the base folder. I created a typography partial and saved it to the base folder. </p>
               <p>I created different component partials that grouped together the major sections of the site.  Inside of the utilities folder, I created variables and mixins partials. In each of the scss sub-folders, I created an _index.scss file. These files are used to import individual partials from each sub-folder.</p>
               <p>I created a styles.scss, which is used to import all of the _index.scss files from the sub-folders. <br> I used Scout-App to watch the Sass directories for changes and then automatically imported those changes to their respective Sass files.</p>
               <p> I created 5 color variables. I created a variable to be used for all media queries. 
               </p>
               <p> I challenged the "exceeds expectations" requirements by using a media query mixin for all media queries, by using nested selectors, by creating a hover effect for buttons, which lighten the button's background color  and by adding a CSS transition so that the color change fades in.</p>
               <p><strong>This project was designed according to the provided mockups.

                          <li>Create a media query mixin.</li>
                          <li>Create a mixin that creates a media query inside of the selector that calls the mixin.</li>
                          <li>The mixin should accept a single parameter for the size of the media query breakpoint.</li>
                          <li>The mixin should create a min-width media query only.</li>
                          <li>Use the media query mixin for all media queries.</li>
                          <li>Use a nested selector structure for at least one component.</li>
                          <li>Create a base selector for a group of related styles.</li>
                          <li>Inside of that selector, use the Sass parent selector: & to append a child class selector to the base. An example would be in the navigation component use .nav as the base selector, and nest .nav-link inside of it.</li>
                          <li>Use built in Sass function to add hover effect.</li>
                          <li>Created a hover effect for buttons.</li>
                          <li>Add a CSS transition so that the color change fades in.</li>
